# RTIC Template

This is my personal template to use for future embedded projects. It is based
on the cortex-m-quickstart (https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart).
It is basically just that, cleaned up to only have the options I need when
using the black pill v1.2 (STM32F401CCU6), with the dependencies and main.rs
updated to work with RTIC.

Cleaning up, I deleted a whole lot of comments explaining the configurations.
For reference of that, go to the original template.

Also, a blink example using a hardware timer is included to serve as a small
reference to the workflow of the framework.
